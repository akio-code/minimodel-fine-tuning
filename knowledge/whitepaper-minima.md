Product and Design Transformation with Surgical Precision

---

## 1. Introduction: The Era of the Misunderstood Product

Technology companies live a paradox: they know they need to deliver value to the customer, but often jump straight into
execution ‚Äî without understanding the real problem, without listening to the user, and without aligning business,
product, and technology.

The result?

- Solutions that don‚Äôt solve real pain points
- Teams stuck between urgency and uncertainty
- Customers who don‚Äôt see value

It is in this scenario that minima was born.

## 2. Why minima exists

minima is a strategic product and design consultancy created by a Lead Product Designer and a Lead Product Developer,
with the mission to transform products, processes, and teams with the minimum necessary ‚Äî and the maximum impact.

We believe that great transformations don‚Äôt need heavy structures. They come from clarity, active listening, business
vision, and well-founded decisions.

## 3. The Problem We Address

Companies like 7COMm face three major recurring bottlenecks:

- üîß **Execution before understanding:** developing systems before grasping the real problem leads to rework,
  misalignment, and customer dissatisfaction.
- üåÄ **Lack of product clarity:** without a clear definition of the ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù design and development teams operate in the
  dark, delivering outputs disconnected from strategy.
- üéØ **Lack of focus on value:** UX becomes interface, discovery becomes meetings, and product becomes backlog. The real
  value for the user and business gets lost.
