## Brand Guidelines

This guide defines the visual language, design principles, and strategic foundations that support minima's identity.

Every detail has been carefully thought out to ensure a cohesive, clear, and intentional brand experience — at every
touchpoint or context.

Minima is about precision, process, and purpose. We are the calculated leap, the silence with meaning. Here, every
decision has a reason why.

This manual presents the essential elements that express this mindset: from typography use to tone of voice, going
through the logic of our visual system.

Whether you're designing a digital interface, writing a message, or defining a new product, these guidelines ensure that
minima continues to be... minima. Only what matters.

## Brand Strategy

In a market saturated with excess, haste, and design for design’s sake, minima was born to do the opposite. What drives
us is intentionality. We believe good solutions aren’t the loudest, but the most conscious.

Minima exists to cut through the noise and measure what matters. We deliver the new with method. We are a design and
innovation studio focused on digital products — from strategy to flow, from system to component. When necessary, we also
restructure brands, but only as part of the path to something greater: a clearer, simpler, and more effective product.

## Personality

Minima’s personality is quietly bold.
We prefer precision over exaggeration.
Clarity over decoration.
And meaning over trend.
We communicate with a direct, smart, light, and always human tone.
We ask difficult questions simply.
And we make the complex easy to understand.

### Your Product, with Purpose

We create interfaces, brands, and experiences that don’t just work — they make sense. Every decision is measured,
tested, and designed to last.

### Less is More When It’s Intentional

We don’t believe in empty minimalism. Minima works with surgical precision: what remains is essential. The rest, we
gladly remove.

### The Process is Minima, the Leap is Maximum

The methodology is clear, the impact is disruptive. Our difference isn’t in the shine, but in the silence before the
breakthrough.

### Need Clarity? We Bring It.

Is there something that doesn’t make sense in your product, brand, or flow? Minima steps in where chaos begins — and
organizes until only what’s necessary remains.

## Logo

The idea behind the logo was born from the attempt to represent the innovation process as it really is: nonlinear,
organic, and full of ruptures.

Along the way, references to movement, trajectory, and behavior of elements in transition were explored — especially the
metaphor of the “bounce,” widely used in motion design and visual storytelling.

These references helped me seek a form that conveyed momentum, energy, and continuity, without falling into the trap of
a decorative or static symbol. The main curve of the logo represents this path with lightness and fluidity.
At the beginning of the exploration, I tested using a pink ellipse (the outlier) to mark the rupture — the leap, the
break from the norm. But, over time, I realized this element was unnecessary. The line’s gesture itself already carries
the intention.
Thus, we arrived at the final form: a simple, imperfect stroke, but full of intention — a movement that speaks for
itself.
